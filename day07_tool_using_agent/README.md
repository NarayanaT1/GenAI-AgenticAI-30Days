# Day 7 → Tool-Using Agent (Search + Calculator)

This demo shows how a simple agent can **use tools** – here: a calculator and a mock search.

## Tools
- **Calculator**: Evaluates math expressions safely (supports +, -, *, /, **, and parentheses)
- **Mock Search**: Looks up short answers from a tiny offline knowledge base

## Run
```bash
python agent_tools_demo.py
```

Try prompts like:
- `2 + 3 * 5`
- `What is LangChain?`
- `Who is the author of Python?`
- `Add 42 and 58`
